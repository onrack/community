# Community Code of Conduct

onRack Networks is a technology organization, but more importantly, it is a community.

We believe that a friendly environment is the best way to get better ideas, better discussions and, in the end, a better product. Let's make this easy for everybody in our community.

## tl;dr
- Be respectful.
- We're on Telegram to help: https://t.me/onrack
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the community.


## Scope
We expect all members of the onRack community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, users, and customers of onRack Networks, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all onRack community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to onRack Networks affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the onRack Networks resources, onRack related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of onRack (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the context of the onRack Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, chat groups, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.


## Friendly Harassment-Free Space
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.


## Abusive behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Abusive behavior may result on banning from the community.


## Copyright violations
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. Please, make sure the code you contribute is yours. We won't accept code that violates a copyright. Please let us know if any code in our repositories is infringing any copyrights through opening an issue on the respective GitHub repository.
